## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine before starting:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/)
- An IDE like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)

## Keycloak Setup

1. **Navigate to the Keycloak Configuration:**
    - Go to the `keycloak_installation` folder in this repository.

2. **Start Keycloak using Docker Compose:**
    - Locate the `docker-compose.yml` file.
    - Run the following command to bring up Keycloak:

      ```bash
      docker-compose up -d
      ```

3. **Access Keycloak:**
    - Keycloak will be accessible at `http://localhost:8090`.
    - The default admin credentials are:
        - **Username**: `admin`
        - **Password**: `password`
    - Log in with these credentials to configure realms, clients, and users as needed.

## Apache Pulsar Setup

1. **Configure the Pulsar Broker:**
    - Navigate to the `pulsar_installation` folder.
    - Open the `customer-broker.conf` file and update the following settings:

      ```properties
      authenticationEnabled=true
      authenticationProviders=org.apache.pulsar.broker.authentication.AuthenticationProviderToken
      authenticationRefreshCheckSeconds=60
      authorizationEnabled=false
      authorizationProvider=
      authorizationAllowWildcardsMatching=false
      superUserRoles=
      brokerClientAuthenticationPlugin=org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.auth.oauth2.AuthenticationOAuth2
      brokerClientAuthenticationParameters={"issuerUrl": "http://{your-keycloak-url}/realms/{your-realm-name}", "privateKey": "file:///pulsar/oauth2.json", "audience": "{your-audience}"}
      tokenPublicKey=file:///pulsar/conf/public_key.der
      ```

    - Replace `{your-keycloak-url}`, `{your-realm-name}`, and `{your-audience}` with your specific Keycloak
      configuration details.

2. **Configure OAuth2 for Pulsar:**
    - Open the `oauth2.json` file in the `pulsar_installation` folder.
    - Replace the content with your Keycloak details:

      ```json
      {
        "client_id": "{your-keycloak-client-id}",
        "client_secret": "{your-keycloak-client-secret}",
        "type": "client_credentials",
        "issuer_url": "http://{your-keycloak-url}/realms/{your-keycloak-realm}"
      }
      ```

    - Ensure that the `{your-keycloak-client-id}`, `{your-keycloak-client-secret}`, `{your-keycloak-url}`, and
      `{your-keycloak-realm}` fields are accurately filled in.

3. **Set Up Public Key for Authentication:**
    - Update the `public_key.pem` file by pasting your Keycloak public key between the `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` and
      `-----END PUBLIC KEY-----` lines.
    - Convert this `.pem` file to `.der` format required by Pulsar:

      ```bash
      openssl x509 -outform der -in public_key.pem -out public_key.der
      ```

4. **Start Pulsar with Docker Compose:**
    - Run the following command to start Pulsar:

      ```bash
      docker-compose up -d
      ```

## Spring Boot Application Setup

1. **Configure OAuth2 Credentials:**
    - Navigate to the `src/main/java/demo` folder.
    - Open the `credentials.json` file and input your Keycloak client details:

      ```json
      {
        "client_id": "{your-client-id}",
        "client_secret": "{your-client-secret}"
      }
      ```

    - Replace `{your-client-id}` and `{your-client-secret}` with your actual credentials.

2. **Application Properties Configuration:**
    - Open the `application.properties` file and update the following settings:

      ```properties
      server.port=8081
      pulsar.issuer-url={your-keycloak-url}
      pulsar.credentials-url={your-credentials.json-file-path}
      pulsar.audience={your-audience}
      spring.pulsar.client.service-url={your-pulsar-url}
      ```

    - Replace the placeholders `{your-keycloak-url}`, `{your-credentials.json-file-path}`, `{your-audience}`, and
      `{your-pulsar-url}` with your specific configuration details.

## Obtaining Keycloak Configuration Details

To correctly configure your application, you need to obtain several Keycloak-specific details:

1. **Issuer URL:**
    - The issuer URL is the base URL of your Keycloak realm. It typically follows this pattern:
      ```
      http://{your-keycloak-url}/realms/{your-realm-name}
      ```
    - To find it, log in to the Keycloak admin console, navigate to your realm, and look for the "Endpoints" tab. The
      issuer URL is listed there.

2. **Public Key:**
    - The public key is used to verify the tokens issued by Keycloak.
    - To get the public key, go to the Keycloak admin console, navigate to your realm settings, and find the "Keys" tab.
      Here, you can view and download the public key in PEM format.

3. **Client ID and Client Secret:**
    - The client ID and secret are necessary for OAuth2 authentication.
    - To obtain these, navigate to the "Clients" section in your Keycloak realm, select your client, and go to the "
      Credentials" tab. The client ID is listed under the "Settings" tab, and the secret can be found in the "
      Credentials" tab.

## Running the Application

1. **Run the Spring Boot Application:**
    - Use your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) to run the application.
    - Ensure the application is configured to run on port `8081`.

2. **Access the Application:**
    - The application will be running on `http://localhost:8081`.

## Sample Endpoints

- **Send Message to Pulsar:**
    - `POST /pulsar/send`

  You can interact with the application using the above endpoint to send messages to Pulsar.

## Conclusion

This project provides a secure and scalable foundation for integrating Apache Pulsar with Keycloak using Spring Boot. By
following the steps outlined above, you will have a fully functioning system ready for further development or
deployment.
